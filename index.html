			<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				<p>Thank you for visiting this webpage! I created this webpage mainly to introduce myself
					to the world. It will include coding projects that I have done, education/professional 
					experience, blog and more. I will be constantly updating this webpage as I learn more and 
					more about web development.

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>My name is Sanghoon Han and I was born in Busan, South Korea and raised in New York. I was introduced to coding when I had to compute complex
					   polynomials. The computer solved complex problems with ease, as long as the user relayed 
					   the information correctly through a high-level language. With the ever-changing world 
					   driven by technology, I decided to learn coding to start a career in this field. Ever since, I started searching through
					   online open sources to study coding. I get a sense of accomplishment whenever I learn something new and 
					   this field provides unlimited knowledge thanks to the internet. I am currently taking classes
					    in Queens College majoring in Computer Science. Also, I am part of the CUNY Tech Prep where 
						I am learning full-stack web development. My future plan is to enroll in a graduate school majoring 
						in Computer Science in order to study artificial intelligence. I hope to gain real-work experience as 
						an intern to experience the real-work environment. I am excited to join this field and will definately have 
						a fun time with it!

			<h2>Projects</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><u>Doubly Linked List (C++)</u> - A doubly linked list is a linked data 
						structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node 
						contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next 
						node in the sequence of nodes.

						<p><u>Tic Tac Toe (C++)</u> - Simple tic tac toe windows application created with Visual Studios.
						It is a classic game for two players, X and O. The player who can place three of their marks in 
						line, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, wins the game.

						<p><u>Damping and Natural Frequency of Beams (Engineering) - </u>Damping is the dissipation of energy of a material 
						or system under cyclic loading, thought of as the restraining of vibratory motion. Logarithmic decrement method is 
						used to measure damping of a cantilever beam by measuring the amount of dissipation that occurs in the beam in each 
						mass location. This project will be an experimental device for future engineering students to observe how mass locations 
						change the damping of the beam and has been nominated in the LACCEI conference.
